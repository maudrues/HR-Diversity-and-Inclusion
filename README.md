## Analysis:

![](welcome.png)   




This is the welcome page introducing the topic under analysis, that is diversity and inclusion by HR Managers when hiring.





![](HR1.png)





The HR Manager hired 500 employees and of which 295 are men ,which is more compared to women.Already we are seeing some sort of exclusion of the female gender? ðŸ¤”.The average perfomance of men is again higher than the female,we can't blame the HR Manager right,when male employees are outperfoming?. More females are being employed for "junior officer" job roles and the number is decreasing as we move to higher levels.After FY20 promotion 13 % are promoted to the Executive position.

The percentage of female employees being promoted from Junior officer to Executive continues to decrease and vice versa for male employees.Females are  likely to promoted to be an Executive if they are from the HR or Sales& Marketing department.In Asia Pacific region no females are being promoted for the Executive,Manager and Senior Officer roles.The higher the job level, the lower the turnover rate.





![](HR2.png)





The Executive split for FY20 AND FY21 is not balanced,it is favouring more of the male employees than females.Most of the employees hired for the Executive role are male andthey are the ones being promoted too which means the HR might not be diversifying and including fairly.







## Recommendations and conclusions
 - HR should promote diversity and inclusion by implementing unbiased hiring practices, provide diversity training, and supporting employee resource groups especially the female so that their average perfomance 
   can increase and there by increasing channces of them being promoted to Executive job roles.
